Crowdfunding_ETL project 2
In this second project, we worked together as a group to manipulate the data provided under a csv. Priorcode folder can be ignored. Final results from our code are in the CSVs and Excel folder. We also included an ERD for consideration. Group members are Roxanne Meyer, Valentina Villarroel and Kayla Rivera. Sources for resources are listed within the code as needed.
